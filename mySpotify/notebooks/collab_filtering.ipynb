    "In our journey to understand recommendation systems, it's vital to get acquainted with some key terms and concepts. Here's your cheat sheet:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Items (or Documents)**: These are the entities that the system is recommending. If we're talking about Netflix, items would be the movies and TV shows. For Spotify, the items would be songs or playlists.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query (or Context)**: This represents the information the system uses to generate recommendations. Queries could include a mix of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - User information or the user's ID.\n",
    "   - Items that the user has previously interacted with.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Embedding**: This is a transformation from a discrete set (like the set of queries or items to recommend) to a vector space, known as the embedding space. The effectiveness of many recommendation systems hinges on learning suitable embedding representations for queries and items.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Recommendation Systems**: These are algorithms designed to suggest products, services, or information to users based on analysis of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Collaborative Filtering**: This technique uses other users' habits to recommend products to a user. The underlying assumption is that if users A and B have similar tastes on one issue, they are likely to have similar opinions on others.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Content-Based Filtering**: This technique recommends items by comparing the content of the items to a user's profile. Each item is represented by a set of descriptors, such as the words in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **User-Item Matrix**: A matrix used in collaborative filtering where each row represents a user, and each column represents an item. The entries can be explicit data (like ratings) or implicit data (like number of purchases).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Cold Start Problem**: This issue arises when the system cannot draw any inferences for users or items about which it has not yet gathered sufficient information. This is a common problem in recommendation systems, particularly for new users (user cold-start) or new items (item cold-start).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Implicit and Explicit Feedback**: Explicit feedback is input directly provided by the user (like ratings), while implicit feedback is gathered from user actions (like browsing history)."

    "Think about a situation where you have a bunch of users and a bunch of items, and you're trying to figure out which items would most likely be of interest to which users. You see this problem everywhere, from recommending movies on Netflix, highlighting relevant content on a homepage, deciding what posts to show in a social media feed, and beyond. There's a nifty solution to this problem that's called collaborative filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how collaborative filtering works: it looks at what items the current user has interacted with or liked, finds other users who have interacted with or liked similar items, and then recommends other items that those users have interacted with or liked.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give you a concrete example, let's say you've been watching a ton of sci-fi action movies from the 70s on Netflix. Now, Netflix might not have these specific details about the films you watched, but it can see that other people who watched the same movies you did also tend to watch other sci-fi action films from the 70s. The interesting part is that to use this approach, we don't really need to know anything about the movies themselves, except for who likes to watch them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering is actually a way to solve a broader class of problems that doesn't necessarily involve users and products. In fact, we usually talk about items instead of products in the context of collaborative filtering. These items could be anything from links that people click on, to diagnoses selected for patients, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the cornerstone of this whole approach is something called latent factors. In our Netflix example, we started with the assumption that you're into old, action-packed sci-fi movies. But you never actually told Netflix that you like these types of movies. And Netflix didn't have to add columns to its movie database saying which films are of these types. But, there must be some latent (or hidden) concept of sci-fi, action, and film age, and these concepts are likely relevant to the movie watching choices of at least some people."

    "The biggest challenge with using collaborative filtering models in practice is the bootstrapping problem. The most extreme version of this problem is when you have no users, and therefore no history to learn from. What products do you recommend to your very first user?\n",
    "\n",
    "But even if you are a well-established company with a long history of user transactions, you still have the question: what do you do when a new user signs up? And indeed, what do you do when you add a new product to your portfolio? There is no magic solution to this problem, and really the solutions that we suggest are just variations of use your common sense. You could assign new users the mean of all of the embedding vectors of your other users, but this has the problem that that particular combination of latent factors may be not at all common (for instance, the average for the science-fiction factor may be high, and the average for the action factor may be low, but it is not that common to find people who like science-fiction without action). Better would probably be to pick some particular user to represent average taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better still is to use a tabular model based on user meta data to construct your initial embedding vector. When a user signs up, think about what questions you could ask them that could help you to understand their tastes. Then you can create a model where the dependent variable is a userâ€™s embedding vector, and the independent variables are the results of the questions that you ask them, along with their signup metadata. We will see in the next section how to create these kinds of tabular models. (You may have noticed that when you sign up for services such as Pandora and Netflix, they tend to ask you a few questions about what genres of movie or music you like; this is how they come up with your initial collaborative filtering recommendations.)\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to be careful of is that a small number of extremely enthusiastic users may end up effectively setting the recommendations for your whole user base. This is a very common problem, for instance, in movie recommendation systems. People that watch anime tend to watch a whole lot of it, and donâ€™t watch very much else, and spend a lot of time putting their ratings on websites. As a result, anime tends to be heavily overrepresented in a lot of best ever movies lists. In this particular case, it can be fairly obvious that you have a problem of representation bias, but if the bias is occurring in the latent factors then it may not be obvious at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a problem can change the entire makeup of your user base, and the behavior of your system. This is particularly true because of positive feedback loops. If a small number of your users tend to set the direction of your recommendation system, then they are naturally going to end up attracting more people like them to your system. And that will, of course, amplify the original representation bias. This type of bias has a natural tendency to be amplified exponentially. You may have seen examples of company executives expressing surprise at how their online platforms rapidly deteriorated in such a way that they expressed values at odds with the values of the founders. In the presence of these kinds of feedback loops, it is easy to see how such a divergence can happen both quickly and in a way that is hidden until it is too late.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a self-reinforcing system like this, we should probably expect these kinds of feedback loops to be the norm, not the exception. Therefore, you should assume that you will see them, plan for that, and identify up front how you will deal with these issues. Try to think about all of the ways in which feedback loops may be represented in your system, and how you might be able to identify them in your data. In the end, this is coming back to our original advice about how to avoid disaster when rolling out any kind of machine learning system. Itâ€™s all about ensuring that there are humans in the loop; that there is careful monitoring, and a gradual and thoughtful rollout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dot product model works quite well, and it is the basis of many successful real-world recommendation systems. This approach to collaborative filtering is known as probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF). Another approach, which generally works similarly well given the same data, is deep learning."
